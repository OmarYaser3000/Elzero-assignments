# Elzero-assignments

This is a repo where I put my solutions to the assignments created by Elzero Web School.
This will contain all the assignments for the HTML, CSS & JS courses.

You can find everything about the courses, assignments & anything [here](https://elzero.org/)

> This repo is not completed yet.

> If you have a better solution to the assignments feel free to make a pull request; BUT note that there may be better overall solutions to some code in a real-case scenario but the code was written according to course requiremnets!
